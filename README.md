# AI-Powered Smart Home (Experimental)

## Overview

This is an experimental project aimed at building an AI-powered smart home system. The project explores the integration of artificial intelligence with home automation technologies to create a more intuitive, efficient, and adaptive living environment.

## Project Goals

- Develop AI agents capable of learning and adapting to homeowners' habits and preferences
- Create a seamless integration between various smart home devices and AI decision-making systems
- Explore novel ways of human-AI interaction in a home setting
- Enhance energy efficiency and comfort through intelligent automation

## Project Structure

This project is set up as a monorepo with the following packages:

- `ai-agents`: Core AI functionality and decision-making systems
- `backend`: Server-side logic and API endpoints
- `frontend`: User interface for interacting with the smart home system
- `shared`: Shared utilities and types used across packages

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   yarn workspace @ai-project/ai-agents dev
   ```

## Current Status

This project is in its early experimental stages. Features and APIs are subject to frequent changes as we explore different approaches and technologies.

## Contributing
